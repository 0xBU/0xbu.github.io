## Learning
You may wish to learn outside of our workshops, and participating in CTFs with us. These are some resources that we believe are good. Don't be overwhelmed - even looking at something listed here once a week is good. We recommend learning through doing, that's why we'd like to see participation in CTFs, and wargames with us. With time, dedication, and effort, becoming an expert can be fun :smile:.

## Wargames
Wargames are a fun way to learn. The goal in them tends to be to use some security skill to obtain a "flag", or password to the next level.

Somewhat ordered by difficulty, easiest at the top. Some focus on different things, try them out and see which you find the most fun. There's plenty more not listed here.

* **[Bandit @ overthewire](http://overthewire.org/wargames/bandit/bandit0.html)**
* [Vortex @ overthewire](http://overthewire.org/wargames/vortex/)
* [ringzer0](http://www.ringzer0team.com/home)

These are the most fun, but most challenging:

* **[Pwnable.kr](http://pwnable.kr/?p=main)**
* [Crypto Challenges](http://cryptopals.com/)
* [Reversing.kr](http://reversing.kr/index.php)
* [CrackMes](http://crackmes.de/)
* [Reverse Engineering Challenges](http://challenges.re/)
