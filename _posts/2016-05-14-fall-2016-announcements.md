Hopefully everyone had a great summer, and is at least somewhat excited to return back to school. 

0xBU will be continuing this semester! For those unfamiliar, 0xBU is a practical cybersecurity club that revolves around learning through hands on activities, such as reverse engineering, digital forensics, patching of vulnerable systems, applied cryptography, and exploitation of systems. Our primary vehicle to these interests is through Capture The Flag (CTF) competitions and through war games. 

In the Spring 2016 semester we participated in ~10 CTFs, and were variously ranked top 10 to 20 in the USA. We’d like to make that top 10 in the world this semester. If you’re interested in participating, or at the very least learning, then please join us this semester. To keep track of us, please use our website, https://0xbu.com and our mailing list http://cs-mailman.bu.edu/mailman/listinfo/builds-list. We typically are either holding a workshop, or participating in a CTF. We meet in the **BUILDS room, 111 Cummington Mall, Room B26.**

There will be a few changes this semester:

* Our meeting time will now be every **Saturday at 12PM (Noon) to 2PM**. Before we met at 7PM on Thursdays, and this caused some students to not be able to attend, due to late classes, and other club commitments.

* Our focus, and main goal, will be **competing (and winning!) in CTF competitions.** This is also in line with our meeting time change - most CTFs run through the weekends.

* Our **mail list will be merged with builds, builds-list@cs.bu.edu**. Maintaining the old mailing list has proven to be cumbersome. We’ll continue using both for a while though.

* Our main form of **team communication will be https://0xbu.slack.com.** Previously we used IRC, which some members are more comfortable with, however requires a special client, and does not support many “modern” expectations such as automatic logging. Whereas Slack requires no special client, handles logging for you, and is easily enhanced with fun modules.

We have prepared some exciting resources, including a **Linux virtual machine packed with hacking tools**, **exciting workshops**, and we are working on creating an **internal to BU wargame/CTF platform**. 

Our **first meeting of the semester will be Saturday, September 10th at 12PM in 111 Cummington Mall, B26.** It will revolve around a workshop of how to reverse engineer different software registration, i.e. cracking. 

The week after will be our first CTF participations, as **two of the best entry-level CTFs will be happening that weekend, September 16th.**

*Cheers,  
Eugene*
