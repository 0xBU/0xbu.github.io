## 1. Install and Learn Linux
Linux is a hackable, and convenient operating system. The internals of it are
very interesting, and the foundation for a lot of engineering. But, they don't
concern you much right now. You just have to be able to navigate around in it,
install programs, and run programs. A virtual machine is easiest.

```
# Absolute basics
ls - list directory contents
cd [path] - change directory to [path]
pwd - print working (current) directory
man [command- pull up the manual for [command]
cat [filename] - print [filename] contents
mv [from_filename] [to_filename] - move a file
cp [from_filename] [to_filename] - copy a file
rm [filename] - remove a file
nano [filename] - open a file for editting
```

## 2. Learn Python and C
My advice is to learn the syntax, and then go further in depth by actually programming with it. Some books are fairly decent too.

#### Syntax

#### Language

## 3. Learn some basics, and the landscape
There's a collection of great CTF videos here: https://www.youtube.com/channel/UClcE-kVhqyiHCcjYwcpfj9w/videos.
Each of them is ~5-10 minutes. Additionally, it's very interesting and useful to read write-ups of previous CTF challenges. They give you the mindset, and teach you the skills necessary, here's a basic set: https://ehsandev.com/pico2014/

## 4. Collect some tools
Security is a very tool oriented field. It's a good idea to know what tools are
out there, and make some of them part of your arsenal.

## 5. Follow what interests you
Whether it's: [game hacking](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hABj_mrP-no), web security, [competing in CTF competitions](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V6hhlvbMFlY),
cryptography,  reverse engineering, or [whatever](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U4oB28ksiIo) that interests you, it's up to
you to continue learning about it.
